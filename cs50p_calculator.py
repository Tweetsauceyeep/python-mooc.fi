# x = float(input("What's x? "))

# this does idek atp bruh (z:,)
# oh it like adds the comma after/before? 3 zeros like idk some formatting stuff

# x = float(input("What's x? "))
# y = float(input("What's y? "))

# z = round(x / y, 2)

def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? "))
    print("x squared is", square(x))

# skipped ahead my solution:
def square(num):
    return num * num

# wow i was right im a god
main()
